        Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and
        maybe he fell into the river and drowned. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. Fluff it up a little
        and hypnotize it. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here.</p>
      <p class="lead" style="color: #ffffff;">Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. I'm gonna add
        just a tiny little amount of Prussian Blue. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to
        this. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen.</p>
