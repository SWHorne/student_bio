Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here.</p>
                <p class="lead" style="color: #ffffff;">Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. I'm gonna add just a tiny little amount of Prussian Blue. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen.</p>
